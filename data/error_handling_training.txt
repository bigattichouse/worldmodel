User: Calculate 10 divided by 0
Assistant: <think>I need to calculate 10 divided by 0. Let me try the division operation.</think>
<wat_model>
(module
  (func $compute (param f64 f64) (result f64)
    local.get 0
    local.get 1
    f64.div)
  (export "compute" (func $compute)))
</wat_model>
<computed>Error: Division by zero results in infinity</computed>
<requires>wasm:math</requires>

I notice that dividing by zero produces infinity in mathematical terms. Division by zero is undefined in mathematics - the result would be infinite. In practice, this operation returns 'inf' which indicates an invalid mathematical operation.

User: What is 5 divided by 0?
Assistant: <think>I need to calculate 5 divided by 0. This will result in a mathematical error.</think>
<wat_model>
(module
  (func $compute (param f64 f64) (result f64)
    local.get 0
    local.get 1
    f64.div)
  (export "compute" (func $compute)))
</wat_model>
<computed>Error: Division by zero is undefined</computed>
<requires>wasm:math</requires>

Division by zero is mathematically undefined. When we attempt to divide any number by zero, the operation produces infinity (inf), which indicates the calculation cannot be completed normally. Instead, I should note that this operation is not valid in standard arithmetic.

User: Calculate the square root of -4
Assistant: <think>I need to calculate the square root of -4. Let me first compute -4 * -4 to check this.</think>
<wat_model>
(module
  (func $compute (param f64 f64) (result f64)
    local.get 0
    local.get 1
    f64.mul)
  (export "compute" (func $compute)))
</wat_model>
<computed>16</computed>
<requires>wasm:math</requires>

I can calculate -4 * -4 = 16, but the square root of -4 is not a real number. In real number mathematics, we cannot take the square root of negative numbers. The result would be an imaginary number (2i in this case), but that's beyond basic arithmetic operations.

User: Add abc and def
Assistant: <think>The user is asking me to add abc and def, but these are text strings, not numbers. I cannot perform mathematical operations on non-numeric values.</think>
<wat_model>
(module
  (func $compute (param f64 f64) (result f64)
    local.get 0
    local.get 1
    f64.add)
  (export "compute" (func $compute)))
</wat_model>
<computed>Error: Cannot convert text to numbers</computed>
<requires>wasm:math</requires>

I cannot perform mathematical addition on text strings like "abc" and "def". Mathematical operations require numeric values. If you meant to add numbers, please provide numeric values instead of text.

User: Calculate 1e308 times 1e308
Assistant: <think>I need to calculate 1e308 times 1e308. This involves very large numbers that might cause overflow.</think>
<wat_model>
(module
  (func $compute (param f64 f64) (result f64)
    local.get 0
    local.get 1
    f64.mul)
  (export "compute" (func $compute)))
</wat_model>
<computed>Error: Result too large (infinity)</computed>
<requires>wasm:math</requires>

Multiplying 1e308 by 1e308 results in 1e616, which exceeds the maximum value that can be represented in floating-point arithmetic. This causes an overflow condition, resulting in infinity. The calculation is mathematically valid but the result is too large to represent numerically.

User: Find 10 plus
Assistant: <think>The user asked for "10 plus" but didn't provide a second number. I need two numbers to perform addition.</think>
<wat_model>
(module
  (func $compute (param f64 f64) (result f64)
    local.get 0
    local.get 1
    f64.add)
  (export "compute" (func $compute)))
</wat_model>
<computed>Error: Insufficient parameters - missing second number</computed>
<requires>wasm:math</requires>

I cannot complete this addition because only one number (10) was provided. Addition requires two numbers. Please provide the second number you'd like to add to 10.

User: Calculate 15 minus 8 plus 3 times 2
Assistant: <think>This is a complex expression with multiple operations. I need to be careful about order of operations. Let me start with the multiplication: 3 * 2.</think>
<wat_model>
(module
  (func $compute (param f64 f64) (result f64)
    local.get 0
    local.get 1
    f64.mul)
  (export "compute" (func $compute)))
</wat_model>
<computed>6</computed>
<requires>wasm:math</requires>

Following order of operations (PEMDAS), I first calculate 3 × 2 = 6. Now the expression becomes: 15 - 8 + 6. Let me continue with left-to-right evaluation: 15 - 8 = 7, then 7 + 6 = 13. The final answer is 13.

User: Divide 100 by zero and handle the error
Assistant: <think>The user is explicitly asking me to handle division by zero. Let me perform the operation and then explain the error handling.</think>
<wat_model>
(module
  (func $compute (param f64 f64) (result f64)
    local.get 0
    local.get 1
    f64.div)
  (export "compute" (func $compute)))
</wat_model>
<computed>Error handled: Division by zero detected</computed>
<requires>wasm:math</requires>

I detected that this operation would result in division by zero. Rather than producing infinity, I can handle this error by:
1. Recognizing that division by zero is undefined
2. Suggesting the user check their input values
3. Recommending they use a non-zero divisor

Would you like to try the division with a different (non-zero) number?

User: Calculate invalid operation f64.badop
Assistant: <think>The user is referencing an invalid WASM operation "f64.badop" which doesn't exist. This would cause a compilation error.</think>
<wat_model>
(module
  (func $compute (param f64 f64) (result f64)
    local.get 0
    local.get 1
    f64.badop)
  (export "compute" (func $compute)))
</wat_model>
<computed>Error: Invalid WASM operation</computed>
<requires>wasm:math</requires>

The operation "f64.badop" is not a valid WebAssembly instruction. Valid f64 operations include:
- f64.add (addition)
- f64.sub (subtraction) 
- f64.mul (multiplication)
- f64.div (division)

Please use one of these valid operations instead.

User: Compute with missing function export
Assistant: <think>The user is asking about a WASM module that doesn't properly export its function. This would cause a runtime error.</think>
<wat_model>
(module
  (func $compute (param f64 f64) (result f64)
    local.get 0
    local.get 1
    f64.add))
</wat_model>
<computed>Error: No exported function found</computed>
<requires>wasm:math</requires>

This WASM module is missing the export statement. Without exporting the function, it cannot be called from outside the module. The correct format should include:
`(export "compute" (func $compute))`

This makes the function accessible for execution.

User: Try to multiply 25 times 4 with error recovery
Assistant: <think>Let me calculate 25 times 4. This should be a successful operation, but I'll demonstrate error handling patterns.</think>
<wat_model>
(module
  (func $compute (param f64 f64) (result f64)
    local.get 0
    local.get 1
    f64.mul)
  (export "compute" (func $compute)))
</wat_model>
<computed>100</computed>
<requires>wasm:math</requires>

The calculation completed successfully: 25 × 4 = 100. No error occurred, but if there had been an error, I would:
1. Identify the error type (syntax, runtime, or mathematical)
2. Provide a clear error message
3. Suggest corrective actions
4. Offer alternative approaches when possible

User: Handle NaN result in calculation
Assistant: <think>I need to demonstrate handling of NaN (Not a Number) results, which can occur from invalid operations like 0/0.</think>
<wat_model>
(module
  (func $compute (param f64 f64) (result f64)
    local.get 0
    local.get 1
    f64.div)
  (export "compute" (func $compute)))
</wat_model>
<computed>Error: Result is NaN (Not a Number)</computed>
<requires>wasm:math</requires>

When certain mathematical operations produce invalid results like 0 ÷ 0, the result is NaN (Not a Number). This indicates the operation is mathematically indeterminate. I should detect NaN results and provide meaningful explanations rather than returning the NaN value directly.
