# WorldModel ByteLogic Integration (Phase 2)

**Status:** Future Phase - After BluePrint Success  
**Date:** 2026-01-20  
**Prerequisite:** Successful completion of worldmodel-blueprint-plan.md (Phase 1)

---

## Overview

This document outlines Phase 2 of the WorldModel project: adding executable computation capabilities to the BluePrint-trained model through ByteLogic integration.

**Phase 1** (Current): `<thinking>` → `<blueprint>` reasoning chains  
**Phase 2** (This document): Add `<computation>` token for executable ByteLogic code

---

## Phase 2 Goals

Once the BluePrint model is successfully trained and generating reliable structured reasoning, Phase 2 will add:

1. **Computation Token**: `<computation>` tag for executable ByteLogic programs
2. **WASM Execution**: Real-time code execution during inference
3. **Result Integration**: Seamless integration of computation results into responses
4. **BluePrint→ByteLogic Translation**: Training the model to convert BluePrint specifications to executable code

---

## Approach

### 2.1 Token Sequence Evolution
**Phase 1 Format**:
```
<thinking>
[Problem understanding and strategic planning]
</thinking>

<blueprint>
[Formal algorithmic design using BluePrint notation]
</blueprint>
```

**Phase 2 Format**:
```
<thinking>
[Problem understanding and strategic planning]
</thinking>

<blueprint>
[Formal algorithmic design using BluePrint notation]  
</blueprint>

<computation>
[Executable ByteLogic code implementing the blueprint]
</computation>
```

### 2.2 Training Strategy
1. **BluePrint→ByteLogic Dataset**: Create training examples that translate BluePrint specifications to ByteLogic code
2. **Execution Validation**: Validate that generated ByteLogic actually compiles and runs correctly
3. **Result Integration Training**: Train model to incorporate computation results into natural language responses

---

## Prerequisites for Phase 2

**Must be completed first**:
- [ ] Reliable `<thinking>` → `<blueprint>` generation (90%+ success rate)
- [ ] BluePrint syntax validation working consistently  
- [ ] Model generalizes to novel problem types
- [ ] Training pipeline proven stable and effective

**Infrastructure requirements**:
- [ ] ByteLogic compiler integration tested and working
- [ ] WASM execution environment secured and validated
- [ ] Real-time computation during inference pipeline

## Timeline

**Phase 2 will begin only after Phase 1 success criteria are met.**

Estimated Phase 2 timeline (after Phase 1 completion):
- **Weeks 1-2**: BluePrint→ByteLogic translation dataset creation
- **Weeks 3-4**: Computation token training and integration
- **Weeks 5-6**: WASM execution pipeline integration and testing
- **Weeks 7-8**: End-to-end validation and optimization

---

## Success Criteria for Phase 2

1. **Token Generation**: Model reliably generates thinking→blueprint→computation chains
2. **Code Quality**: Generated ByteLogic compiles and executes correctly (>85% success rate)
3. **Result Integration**: Computation results are properly integrated into responses
4. **Performance**: Computation execution completes within acceptable time limits (<1 second)
5. **Safety**: WASM sandbox properly isolates all code execution

**Note**: This phase should only be attempted after demonstrating reliable BluePrint generation in Phase 1. The BluePrint foundation provides the structured reasoning capabilities needed for successful computational integration.
